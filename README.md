# scXpresso: predicting cell population-specific gene expression levels

<img src="scEP.png" width="350" align="right">

We present scXpresso: a method that predicts gene expression at an unprecedented resolution using single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Using this GitHub, you can reproduce the figures from the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.06.506837v1), train your own models, or look at the predicted effect of interesting variants. 

The results, trained models, input sequences etc. can all be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7044908).

### Code
This folder contains the code to train your own models. Python version 3.6 or higher and PyTorch version 1.9 or higher is required for this.

### Tutorials
Here, we explain step-by-step how to train your own models and look at interesting variants or apply in-silico mutagenesis.
